Based on the insight gained after pulling data from past successful and failed kickstarter theatre projects, I recommend Louise try for a kickstarter pledge goal of under $2000. This is half of the originally planned goal, which I feel is necessary to have the largest chance of success based on the data analyzed. This conclusion was based on insight pulled from vlookups, pivot table insight, charts, graphs, plots, as well as descriptive statistics.
