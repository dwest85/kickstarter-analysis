# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on data to uncover trends for Louise's future Kickstarter campaign to maximize the outcome of acheiving a succesfully pledged campaign.

### Purpose
The purpose for this analysis project was to gain insight based off of the relation of past failed and successful kickstarter campaigns. This data will help Louise drive her own campaign strategy using several pieces of visulaization created in hopes of maximizing the chance of running a successfull campaign. This information will also allow Louise to rank her own success vs the success of similar kickstarter campaign projects.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the insight gained after pulling data from past successful and failed kickstarter theatre projects, I recommend Louise try for a kickstarter pledge goal of under $2000. This is half of the originally planned goal, which I feel is necessary to have the largest chance of success based on the data analyzed. This conclusion was based on insight pulled from vlookups, pivot table insight, charts, graphs, plots, as well as descriptive statistics.
