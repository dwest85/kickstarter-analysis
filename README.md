# Kickstarter Analysis Project

## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on data to uncover trends for Louise's future Kickstarter campaign to maximize the outcome of acheiving a succesfully pledged campaign.

### Purpose
The purpose for this analysis project was to gain insight based off of the relation of past failed and successful kickstarter campaigns. This data will help Louise drive her own campaign strategy using several pieces of visulaization in the hopes of maximizing the chance of running a successfull campaign. This information will also allow Louise to rank her own success vs the success of similar kickstarter campaign projects.

## Analysis and Challenges
Breaking down the information into easily digestable data was the first challenge (example: color coding the outcomes). Filtering this data using several different filters, as well as pivot tables allowed for more readable data. 

VLOOKUPS were also helpful with pulling very specific data quickly to pair up against Louise's campaign strategy (similar theater kickstarters that Louise selected as well as their goals and pledged data.)

Descriptive statistics also helped root out a strong potential kickstarter goal based off of the Successful and Failed Kickstarter information.

Also, functions, such as =COUNTIFS() helped break down large groups of data in order to easily track and use the information (such as Outcomes Based on Goal data).


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
Based on the insight gained after pulling data from past successful and failed kickstarter theatre projects, I recommend Louise try for a kickstarter pledge goal of under $2000. This is half of the originally planned goal, which I feel is necessary to have the largest chance of success based on the data analyzed. This conclusion was based on insight pulled from vlookups, pivot table insight, charts, graphs, plots, as well as descriptive statistics.

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
